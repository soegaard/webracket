## MathJax

> MathJax is an open-source JavaScript display engine for LaTeX, MathML,
> and AsciiMath notation that works in all modern browsers, with
> built-in support for assistive technology like screen readers,
> including automatic speech generation and an expression explorer that
> can be used to investigate typeset mathematics on a more granular
> level than the complete expression. It requires no setup on the part
> of the user (no plugins to download or software to install), so the
> page author can write web documents that include mathematics and be
> confident that users will be able to view it naturally and
> easily. Simply include MathJax and some mathematics in a web page, and
> MathJax does the rest.
